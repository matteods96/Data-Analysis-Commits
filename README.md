# SoftwareEngineeringProject Project Course
The aim of the project was to analyze the raw data to provide new valuable insights using statistic methods, visualizations and application of supervised models . 
The main goal achieved was the creation of a model, predicting the grade assigned to a project, fitting to new several patterns including the evenness, the earliness, the lateness and the even contribution, discovered from the analysis of data set containing information related to commits.
The project was mainly implemented in Python

FILES:
- commits.csv file  to analyze
- grades.json file containg a grade for each commit
- GUIDE.pdf file provide an overview of the the project

In addition, in the folder I load files related  explanation of some implementation in Python which I did during the software_engineering_Project Course in addition to the main project related to the data analysis of commits
